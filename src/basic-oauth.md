# Add Integrations

Allow FounderGPT to utilize your account in a third-party service. For example, allow FounderGPT to manage your Google Calendar, or send emails for you via Gmail.

-   Takes an authorization code, code verifier, and redirect URI after logging into the third-party service via OAuth PKCE, and saves the third-party token to the user's account, allowing FounderGPT to access the third-party service on the user's behalf.
-   Follows OAuth 2.0 PKCE flow (learn more [here](https://oauth.net/2/pkce/)).
